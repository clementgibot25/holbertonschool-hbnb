# HBNB - Holberton BnB
Welcome to the HBNB project, a full-stack web application that allows users to rent places for short periods of time, similar to Airbnb. This project is developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## Table of Contents
1. [UML Diagrams](./part_1)
2. [BM & API](./part_2)
3. [Auth & API](./part_3)
4. [Web interface](./part_4)

## UML Diagrams (Part 1 - Completed)
The first part of the project focuses on system design using UML diagrams. The following diagrams are included in the `part_1` directory:

- **Package Diagram**: A package diagram showing the structural organization of the HBNB application at a global level.
- **Business Logic Layer**: A class diagram showing the core entities (BaseModel, User, Place, Amenity, Review) and their relationships.
- **Fetch Places**: A sequence diagram illustrating the process of searching and retrieving places.
- **Place Creation**: A sequence diagram demonstrating the flow of creating a new place.
- **User Registration**: A sequence diagram showing the user registration process.
- **Submit Review**: A sequence diagram for the review submission and validation process.

## BM & API (Part 2 - Completed)
The second part of the project implements the core API and business logic for a simplified AirBnB clone using Python, Flask, and Flask-RESTx. It is organized in a modular, scalable way to separate presentation, business, and persistence layers, and prepares for future extensions like database integration and authentication.

**Key Features:**
- RESTful API endpoints for Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- In-memory data persistence with repository pattern
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Auto-generated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Facade pattern for clean business logic orchestration
